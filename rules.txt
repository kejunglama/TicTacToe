Here are the game rules:

Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. 

The game starts with an empty grid, and each player takes turns placing their symbol (either "X" or "O") on the grid, until one player gets three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the grid is full and no more moves can be made.

The first player to get three of their symbols in a row wins the game. If the grid is full and no player has won, the game is a tie.

To make a move, a player chooses an empty cell on the grid and places their symbol in that cell. Players take turns making moves until the game is over.

In this version of the game we will play against the computer. We assume that the computer is playing as X, and the human is playing as O.
